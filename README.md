# AWSWordpressDemo

By using AWS EC2 service I was able to create a wordpress webpage article which is accessible all over the globe. Currently the webpage can be accessed only on a http protocol and not on a https protocol. Further testing would be done to make it operational on the https protocol and to add a personal domain name to it. Currently this is the website address - http://13.234.39.173/wordpress/
